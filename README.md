This Python script is designed to automatically generate a summary of meeting minutes stored in a ⁠ .docx ⁠ file using the OpenRouter AI API. Here's a breakdown of what each part does and how it helps you:

What the Code Does (Step-by-Step)

1. Reads a ⁠ .docx ⁠ file
•⁠  ⁠The function ⁠ read_docx(file_path) ⁠:
  - Opens the Word document.
  - Extracts all non-empty paragraphs.
  - Joins them into a single text string.
  - Returns the full text for summarization.

2. Sends the text to OpenRouter AI
•⁠  ⁠The function ⁠ summarize_text(text) ⁠:
  - Prepares a prompt asking the AI to summarize the meeting minutes.
  - Sends the request to OpenRouter’s API using the specified model (⁠ google/gemma-2-9b-it:free ⁠).
  - Receives and returns the summary.

3. Runs from the command line
•⁠  ⁠You run the script like this:
  ⁠ bash
  python summarizer.py path/to/your/meeting_minutes.docx
   ⁠
•⁠  ⁠It checks:
  - That you provided a file path.
  - That the file is a ⁠ .docx ⁠.
  - That the file exists and contains text.

4. Prints the result
•⁠  ⁠It shows:
  - The number of characters extracted.
  - The generated summary from the AI.
